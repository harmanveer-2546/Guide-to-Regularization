# Preventing Overfitting: A Guide to Regularization

Regularization is a crucial technique in machine learning that helps to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs 
when a model becomes too complex and learns the training data so well that it fails to generalize to new, unseen 
data. This can lead to poor performance on real-world applications.  

By introducing a penalty term to the loss function, regularization discourages models from becoming overly complex.
This penalty term is calculated based on the magnitude of the model's parameters.  

### Common Regularization Techniques:

* L1 Regularization (Lasso): This technique encourages sparsity, meaning many model parameters are driven to zero. This can be useful for feature selection,
     as it can help identify the most important features.  
* L2 Regularization (Ridge): L2 regularization prevents individual parameters from becoming too large, which can help to reduce the variance of the model.  
* Elastic Net: This is a combination of L1 and L2 regularization, which can be useful when both feature selection and reducing variance are important.

### When to Use Regularization:

* Limited Training Data: When you have limited training data, regularization can help prevent overfitting by preventing the model from memorizing the training set.
* High-Dimensional Data: With many features, regularization can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.
* Preventing Overfitting: Regularization is a general technique for preventing overfitting in various machine learning models.

### Key Benefits of Regularization:

* Improved Generalization: Regularization helps models generalize unseen data better.  
* Reduced Overfitting: It prevents models from becoming too complex and memorizing the training data.  
* Feature Selection: L1 regularization can be used for feature selection.  
* Enhanced Model Stability: Regularization can make models more stable and less sensitive to small changes in the data.
